ECE1387 Assignment 1 README file (Single Router)
- developer:	Louis Chen

Please read this file before compiling and launching the maze router.

Please follow the steps below to achieve successful compilation.
1)  Use <cd> to switch to the "a1" directory.
2)  Type <make> or <make all> to compile the source code.
    This will generate an executable called "MazeRouter-LouisChen".
3)  Type <make clean> if wish to clean the project.

Please follow the steps below to launch the application successfully.
4)  Use <pwd> to make sure current directory is "a1".
5)  To run the application, type <./MazeRouter-LouisChen "cct-file-path">.
    The cct files are not attached in the folder. User can add flags after
    the command to enable/disable graphics, debug mode, and optimization.
    Available flags are shown as follows.

	-displayMode=on		// turns on graphics display
	-displayMode=off	// turns off graphics display
	-debugMode=on		// turns on debug mode, which prints out
				   connection paths and track map
	-debugMode=off		// turns off debug mode
	-multiLoadOpt=on	// enables multiple-load-pin optimization
	-multiLoadOpt=off	// disables multiple-load-pin optimization

    e.g. To turn on debug mode and turn off optimization
	./MazeRouter-LouisChen -debugMode=on -multiLoadOpt=off
	 To turn off graphics display
	./MazeRouter-LouisChen -displayMode=off

    Flags are processed regardless of the order in which they are entered.
    If no flags are specified (with below command), by default display is on,
    debug mode is off, and optimization is on.
	./MazeRouter-LouisChen

Please go to step 12) if display mode is turned off.
6)  Now the program should pop up the display with correct grid and track width
    sizing. To run the maze routing algorithm, please press <Proceed>.
7)  Please observe the command line. If it says "Staring updateDisplay.", it
    means router has solved all connection paths. Otherwise, wait for it.
8)  Now user may press <Next Path> to display one path at a time, or press
    <All Paths> to display all paths at once. Paths are colored differently
    in the order they are displayed to give user a clear sight.
9)  All logic blocks are colored in dark gray, and all combined switch/connection
    blocks are colored in light gray.
10) User can also press <Window> or <Zoom In> to see the logic block coordinates
    and pin/track indices.
11)  Press <Proceed> or <Exit> anytime user wishes to close the program.
12) The command line should have shown the number of shuffles required to solve
    the input circuit, the number of used/available tracks, the minimum number of
    tracks left unoccupied in the most congested track channel. The command line
    should have also shown the track/path info if the debug mode is enabled.

Hope you had a great time exploring my maze routing program! :)
