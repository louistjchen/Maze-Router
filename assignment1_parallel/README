ECE1387 Assignment 1 README file (Parallel Router)
- developer:	Louis Chen
- date:		Oct 10, 2018

Please read this file before compiling and launching the parallelization
demonstration of the maze router.

Be sure to read my assignment summary report Section III before assessing
the program in order to get a full picture of what the program tries to do.

This parallel router does not support graphics display.

Please follow the steps below to achieve successful compilation.
1)  Use <cd> to switch to the "a1_parallel" directory.
2)  Type <make> or <make all> to compile the source code.
    This will generate an executable called "MazeRouterParallel-LouisChen".
3)  Type <make clean> if wish to clean the project.

Please follow the steps below to launch the application successfully.
4)  Use <pwd> to make sure current directory is "a1_parallel".
5)  To run the application, type <./MazeRouterParallel-LouisChen "cct-file-path">.
    The cct files are not attached in the folder.

Please follow the steps to correctly interpret the results.
6)  Now the program should show some results in the command line.
    Results include timestamps of executing each of the 4 threads,
    number of shuffles required to solve each threaded, and some
    error messages showing any unroute path before each shuffle.

    The 4 threads have different configuration parameters:
      a) Thread 1: Optimization off, forward traversal
      b) Thread 2: Optimization off, backward traversal
      c) Thread 3: Optimization on, forward traversal
      d) Thread 4: Optimization on, backward traversal

    Please note that the order in which the [RESULT...] messages
    appear does not reflect on the thread numbering. Instead it
    reflects on the order in which the threaded routers finish
    their routing tasks.

Hope you had a great time exploring my parallel router program! :)
